## Why is open source a true alternative for many applications? /1 {.smaller .build}

- software development companys like windows, apple and co.  produce usable, mostly  even good software
- but:

    - products are getting increasingly expansive and update dependent
    - the (end) users loose their independence and individuality
    - (end) users can only to a certain degree personalize and optimize the applications for their needs
    - most of those products can lead to results, but they are not efficent nor powerful
    --> users are more and more degraded to consumers, than rather beeing their own developers
    
## Why is open source a true alternative for many applications? /2    

  > Why not use open source tools, with millions of active developers and support, that can be more powerful, efficent and elegant than commercial products?

  - automate everything, that can be automated
  
  - after doing the exact same operation more than three times, write a function for it, automate it
