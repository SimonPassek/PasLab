	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To investigate the impact of {HPV} status in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}), who received surgery and cisplatin-based postoperative radiochemotherapy.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: For 221 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity treated at the 8 partner sites of the German Cancer Consortium, the impact of {HPV} {DNA}, p16 overexpression and p53 expression on outcome were retrospectively analysed. The primary endpoint was loco-regional tumour control; secondary endpoints were distant metastases and overall survival.
{RESULTS}: In the total patient population, univariate analyses revealed a significant impact of {HPV}16 {DNA} positivity, p16 overexpression, p53 positivity and tumour site on loco-regional tumour control. Multivariate analysis stratified for tumour site showed that positive {HPV} 16 {DNA} status correlated with loco-regional tumour control in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (p=0.02) but not in the oral cavity carcinoma group. Multivariate evaluation of the secondary endpoints in the total population revealed a significant association of {HPV}16 {DNA} positivity with overall survival (p{\textless}0.01) but not with distant metastases.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {HPV}16 {DNA} status appears to be a strong prognosticator of loco-regional tumour control after postoperative cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy of locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma and is now being explored in a prospective validation trial.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify and independently validate a novel gene signature predicting locoregional tumor control ({LRC}) for treatment individualization of patients with locally advanced {HPV}-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ({HNSCC}) who are treated with postoperative radio(chemo)therapy ({PORT}-C).Experimental Design: Gene expression analyses were performed using {NanoString} technology on a multicenter training cohort of 130 patients and an independent validation cohort of 121 patients. The analyzed gene set was composed of genes with a previously reported association with radio(chemo)sensitivity or resistance to radio(chemo)therapy. Gene selection and model building were performed comparing several machine-learning algorithms.Results: We identified a 7-gene signature consisting of the three individual genes {HILPDA}, {CD}24, {TCF}3, and one metagene combining the highly correlated genes {SERPINE}1, {INHBA}, P4HA2, and {ACTN}1 The 7-gene signature was used, in combination with clinical parameters, to fit a multivariable Cox model to the training data (concordance index, ci = 0.82), which was successfully validated (ci = 0.71). The signature showed improved performance compared with clinical parameters alone (ci = 0.66) and with a previously published model including hypoxia-associated genes and cancer stem cell markers (ci = 0.65). It was used to stratify patients into groups with low and high risk of recurrence, leading to significant differences in {LRC} in training and validation (P {\textless} 0.001).Conclusions: We have identified and validated the first hypothesis-based gene signature for {HPV}-negative {HNSCC} treated by {PORT}-C including genes related to several radiobiological aspects. A prospective validation is planned in an ongoing prospective clinical trial before potential application in clinical trials for patient stratification.
